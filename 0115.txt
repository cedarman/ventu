What can I say about this day and start going thru the aos process. It's a big stress and hopefully me and my wife we will go thrhu this without 
kill each othe. Today I call my family.
They are all ok and they seems very happy to see me. And of course
my heart is so warm when I see them smile and be happy.
Thanks God.
